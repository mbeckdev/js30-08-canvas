## Fun things to do with canvas:

*comment out lineJoin and lineCap and it looks like

This makes the color change, "hue" here is a variable that changes. We just push the hue variable from 0 to 360 to get all the colors.

Even if the hue is over, it still gives you a color. We set it back to 0 though.

## Notes for the future

I could make a slider for line width, color pretty easily.  Then eventually figure out why you'd want that.. haha but it's possible!
